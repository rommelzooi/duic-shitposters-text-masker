# DUIC shitposters text masker
Shit will be shit. This Firefox Add-on literally turns posts of infamous blacklisted DUIC shitposters into shit.

[DUIC](https://www.duic.nl) is a local news site based in the city of Utrecht (Netherlands). It is a valuable news source, but is suffers from some infamous shitposters. This Add-on was not made to deny their existence, but just to give some relief in a fun way.

# Installation


### Development

Developers can run this extenstion in development mode using the [web-ext command line tool](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext).

**example**

$web-ext -s webext run --start-url https://www.duic.nl/algemeen/grote-brand-bij-busstalling-westraven-in-utrecht-vijftien-bussen-getroffen-meerdere-volledige-uitgebrand/
```

# Further work

In time this project may become more general purpose. Also having a user configurable blacklist is on the todo list.
